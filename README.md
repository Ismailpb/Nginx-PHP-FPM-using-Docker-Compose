# Nginx-PHP-FPM-using-Docker-Compose

Here is a simple project discussing about configuring a PHP website on a docker container using Nginx and php-fpm. Also I installed a self signed SSL certificate to it.

I'm using docker compose to build the structure



# Result

Run the docker-compose command once the configuration is ready

```
# docker-compose up -d
Creating network "docker-project_netapp" with the default driver
Creating nginx      ... done
Creating php-server ... done
]#
```
